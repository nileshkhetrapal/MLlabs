# Lab 0: Introduction to Machine Learning with Teachable Machine

In this lab, you will learn to use Google's Teachable Machine, a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. You'll be creating a simple classifier to differentiate between images of Ferraris and Lamborghinis.

## Step 1: Gather the Dataset

First, you'll need to gather images of Ferraris and Lamborghinis. You can download these from the internet or take pictures yourself. Remember, the more diverse your dataset (different angles, lighting conditions, models of the cars, etc.), the better your model will perform.

## Step 2: Create a New Project on Teachable Machine

1. Go to [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) and click on 'Get Started'.
2. Choose 'Image Project'.
   
## Step 3: Upload Your Dataset

1. Click on 'Upload' under 'Class 1'. Upload your Ferrari images here.
2. Click 'Add Class' to create 'Class 2' and upload your Lamborghini images here.

## Step 4: Train Your Model

1. Click on 'Train Model'.
2. Wait until the training process reaches 100%.

## Step 5: Test and Export Your Model

1. Test your model using the 'Webcam' or 'Upload' option.
2. If you're satisfied with the results, click on 'Export Model'. Choose 'Tensorflow.js' > 'Upload my model' > 'Copy' to get a link to your model.

**Questions:**
1. How does the number and diversity of images in your dataset affect the accuracy of your model?
2. What are some limitations of the model you built using Teachable Machine?
